# Buggy-RPG
My super buggy incomplete fantasy RPG game

Three playable characters: Knight, Archer and, Assassin.


The Archer and Assassin's character roles aren't complete.
After killing the first two monsters with those characters you can't go on to the second level.

Still a lot of things to be worked on like being able to use the special items which are very unexpected.
Also things like the amount of damage taken from each hit with your amount of defense.

Will also be appending a menu and restart options and many different functions to align with the RPG.

But still was a entertaining project to work on.
